***Introductory CS Theory Visualizer Toolkit***

This is a repository for visualizations of introductory CS theory course concepts. It is meant to be used by both instructors and students to support their goals.
For students, this repository will generate visuals of common conversions and concepts within the course.
For instructors, this repository will allow you to automatically generate step-by-step solutions with explanations for common conversions.  

**Todos**

Concepts:
- Finite Automata, for the formal definition and simulation (DFA, NFA, regex, CFG, PDA, DPDA, TM, multi-tape TM, NTM)

Conversions:
- NFA to DFA
- DFA/NFA to Regex (GNFA conversion)
- Regex to NFA
- CFG to PDA
- PDA to CFG
- NTM to TM

Transformations:
- General-purpose reductions
- Language transformations (e.g., $L$ to $half(L) = \{x : xy \in L, |x|=|y|\}$).
