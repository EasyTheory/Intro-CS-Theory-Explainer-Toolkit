***Introductory CS Theory Explainer Toolkit***

This is a repository for visualizations of introductory CS theory course concepts. It is meant to be used by both instructors and students to support their goals.
The primary use-case is for instructors to automatically generate step-by-step solutions with explanations.  

**Todos**

Concepts:
- Finite Automata, for the formal definition and simulation (DFA, NFA, regex, CFG, PDA, DPDA, TM, multi-tape TM, NTM)

Conversions:
- NFA to DFA
- DFA/NFA to Regex (GNFA conversion)
- Regex to NFA
- CFG to PDA
- PDA to CFG
- NTM to TM

Transformations:
- General-purpose reductions
- Language transformations (e.g., $L$ to $half(L) = \{x : xy \in L, |x|=|y|\}$).
